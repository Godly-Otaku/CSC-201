Should the San Francisco 49ers unexpectedly release quarterback Colin Kaepernick in a final round of roster cuts on Saturday, he might have an interesting barrier to his next NFL job: ownership.

Citing the controversial and highly visible nature of Kaepernics national anthem protest, four highly ranked executives from the four clubs said even discussing Kaepernick as an option in the future would require ownership signoff in their respective franchises.

However youre looking at it, [signing or trading for Kaepernick] is an endorsement of how the situation has been handled, one executive said. ?I have to explain to [my team owner] that a guy is going to [protest] the national anthem and draw attention to himself over the rest of the team. But I?ve got to say, Heres why we want to attach our franchise to this. ? Its not happening without him being OK with it.
